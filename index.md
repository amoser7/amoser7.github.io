# Welcome to my CIT Code Portfolio!

### My name is Alexandria Moser and here are some examples of projects I have completed in my studies so far.

## To begin with, we learned how to use GitHub and clone a git repository locally. Our first project required us to complete coursework regarding GitHub and create a GitHub page with a picture showing we were successful.

## For our next project, we learned how to use APIs for the Flickr and 500px applications.

## Finally, we learned how to incorporate more than photography APIs and made Unsplash (photos) and Youtube (video) applications.
